---------------------------------------
Event Scheduling  // Suggested modification of phase progress, removed redundant phases.
A turn must proceed as follows
--------------------------------------
Default Roll :
	Roll your dice, then you move your tokens to the amount rolled. If a double is rolled, roll again.
	Trigger roll related card effects. Negative effects on you are negated for the turn by rolling a double.
	DICE AMOUNT = x2.

Assessment Phase :
	Any delayed effects from turns executed prior (by any player targetting you,
	or you targetting any player) are checked.
	
Action Phase :
	Play a maximum of two cards unless interrupted by other effects. Discard any cards you don't want to the discard pile.
	
Dice Card Effects :
	DICE AMOUNT = x1.
	
End Phase : Turn ends, Draw a card if you possess a token. Trigger draw related card effects.



----------------------------------------
Limitations

These are strict rules that aims to 
balance the overall gameplay experience. 
----------------------------------------

Hand Limit :
	Hand size limit for each player is 4. Extra cards are discarded to the "Discard Pile"
	at the player's turn end.
	
Play Limit :
	Only two cards max may be played per turn.

Discard Pile :
	LIMIT = x10
	The size of the discard pile is 10. Follows FIFO logic, once the limit of 10 is reached the oldest card in the pile is thrown out.

Double Rules: 
	3 consecutive double rolls = Lose your next turn. 


-------------------------------------------------
Tile Hazard Effects

-------------------------------------------------
	Pit: Move backwards 4 spaces.
	Blaze: You shall not pass.
	Thorns: Your token will become stuck where they land for two turns.
	Slippery: Your token will slide right to the end from where they land.
